	<span><h1>Control room</h1>
		I braided my hair to survive the journey, cleaned the eaves of the old house, and waited. It was an hour before you arrived that I knew: something was creeping underneath the floorboards. Something you controlled, that I didn’t understand, and that I could not face. I walked by the water for an hour listening to songs about the devil to calm my nerve. When you came back I knew something was awry, but I didn’t know the shape nor the size of it. You took me outside and vomited black.
